                            What's more important a goal or process on the way to that goal? The first answer that comes into my mind is a goal. But let's give it a second thought. The goal is something that we desire to get in the future.
                            Once the goal is set you can't control it. On the other hand, the process is something that we have a full control of.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We are worried too much because we can't reach the goal as fast as we planned. At the same time, if the process is right, we aren't frustrated or worried that much. During the process, we have small wins that
                            satisfy and motivate us to move to the next step. You can feel that you live in a moment. When the process is right and you enjoy it every minute, most likely the outcome will bring one of the best feelings-
                            satisfaction. Hence, commit your focus to the process, system, your way of achieving a goal. For instance, imagine you are going to the amusement park, your favorite one let's say Six Flags. Six Flags is a goal.
                            On a sunny day, you prepared your car, put gas in it, bought some food and drinks, prepared the road music, and ready to go.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It takes two hours according to Google maps to get there. In your mind, in two hours you're going to have some fun, adrenaline rush and you already feel it's going to be one of the best days. But on the way, it
                            starts raining, a cop gives you a ticket for not using turning lights and you get a flat tire. For sure, you are frustrated cause it isn't in your plan. But imagine if you focus on a process, you will feel it's
                            just a part of an adventure. Focus on a process rather than a goal.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            There's a famous architecture story about an architect who designed a library. It was perfect in every way, a masterpiece on the blueprint. But every year, it would sink a couple of inches into the ground.
                            Eventually, the building was condemned. Do you know why? He forgot to account for the weight of the books. You can't plan everything because even a slight mistake can lead to a fiasco.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I do believe that a human being can achieve anything he truly desires. The recipe is simple yet very complex. Hard work + passion + time = result. Having some result that is not satisfactory is better than having
                            nothing at all. Commit to a process, it's a long run but always rewarding.
